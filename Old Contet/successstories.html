 <h2>Devendra Vhaghade (Self-Employment Scheme)</h2>
 <p class="paragraph" style="font-size:15px;Margin-top:10px;">
"Who said that the blind cannot be Edison? Come and experience it yourself. 
            I was born and brought up in the Gondhiya district of Maharashtra 
            and was part of the MNB Vocational Centre.<br>
            <br>
            "While making hangers, I learned about the various cables. After this, 
            the magic started where I could differentiate the male cables from 
            the female ones. Without attending any classes on Physics, I managed 
            to learn the trick of giving supply to electronic products. After 
            a discussion with the project coordinator of the Self Employment Scheme, 
            I came to the conclusion that the sound service business would help 
            me stand on my own feet in my native place that is popularly known 
            as "Naxalite affected area".<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            MNB provided the assistance I needed, speakers, a tent and different 
            types of lights. Today my business is doing well and I have plans 
            to expand it by purchasing other decorative items that are in demand. 
            This has helped me earn respect in society and my disability is no 
            longer a barrier."<br>

 <h2>Ramesh Sawant (Self-Employment Scheme)</h2>
 <p class="paragraph" style="font-size:15px;Margin-top:10px;">
Ramesh Sawant a resident of Mumbai was partially visually impaired 
            since childhood and then he met with an accident due to which he became 
            totally blind. Ramesh joined MNB as a trainee under the 4 year vocational 
            training course and was trained in many different trades.<br>
            Subsequent to his training Ramesh tried his hand at several businesses 
            like making flower garlands, selling coconuts and vegetables to earn 
            a livelihood but the income from these selling were not sufficient 
            to sustain his family.<br>
            <br>
            So eventually he started selling blouse pieces and falls, and it has 
            turned out to be a good venture hence Mr Ramesh Sawant had filed an 
            application with the MNB under the self-employment scheme to secure 
            funds for expanding his business.<br>
            <br>
            MNB Industrial Home provided blouse pieces, petty-coats and falls 
            worth Rs. 30,000/- to Mr Ramesh Sawant. This financial aid brought 
            about a significant difference in the life of Mr Sawant. During the 
            very first season of Diwali he was able to sell material worth Rs. 
            12000/- on which he earned a profit of Rs. 3500/-. His wife and children 
            had contributed equally in his business, and therefore after a period 
            of 1 year he started two STD coin boxes and thus increased his capital 
            material.<br>
            <br>
            We felt that our scheme could be the catalyst for the success of his 
            entrepreneur activity. Today Mr. Ramesh Sawant is the best example 
            of an entrepreneur to the visually challenged persons who wish to 
            start their own business with the help of the "Self Employment" scheme 
            run by MNB.<br>

 <h2>Namdeo Jadhav (Ex Trainee)</h2>
 <p class="paragraph" style="font-size:15px;Margin-top:10px;">
The light of education removed the darkness of life.<br>
            <br>
            Namdeo Jadhav, successfully completed his SSC from Nasik, despite 
            being visually challenged. Since the economic background of his family 
            was not good enough to support him in his education, he did not join 
            any college and instead took admission for the 4-year training in 
            MNB. During this training Namdeo always showed keenness in learning 
            new things and also took an active part in different activities organized 
            by the Home. It was this active participation that showed him the 
            path to continue his education. Namdeo successfully completed his 
            graduation from the Mumbai University and this was the beginning of 
            his struggle to earn a living.<br>
            <br>
            Namdeo appeared for the Staff Selection Exam and because of his intellect 
            and hard work he was selected as a telephone operator at Khadi and 
            Village Industrial Commission (KVIC).<br>
            <br>
            Today Namdeo is married and has 3 lovely children and this gives him 
            a sense of accomplishment as he is able to fulfill his responsibilities 
            towards his family and work. Thus, Namdeo has proved that the effort 
            put in for his education brought him into the mainstream.<br>

            due to her visual impairment. However things changed for the better 
            after she took up the MS-CIT course conducted at MNB, as the course 
            helped her gain knowledge and also provided her the much needed confidence 
            to compete in the job market. Suvarna after securing a job with Indian 
            Railways as a computer operator is now married and well settled in 
            life. <br>

            times.<br>
            <br>
            <h2>Nisha Ramesh Gaikwad ( Computer Centre &amp; ACTC)</h2><br>
            Nisha Gaikwad is a diploma holder in Hotel Management working at the 
            ITC Hotel, as a house-keeping attendant. Tragedy struck soon after 
            she got married when she was detected with Retinitis pigmentosa. This 
            not only forced her to quit her job, but also caused problems in her 
            married life.<br>
            <br>
            She is grateful to MNB. "Just when I thought my life was finished, 
            I got to know about the various computer courses being conducted by 
            MNB for the visually challenged. I also successfully completed their 
            MS-CIT Course and the Advanced Computer Training Course (ACTC) run 
            by MNB in collaboration with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Today 
            thanks to the MNB Computer Centre my computer knowledge has been 
            greatly enhanced and d my outlook to life has become more positive. 
            I feel confident to enter the corporate world and once again stand

            <h2>Tapasya Suresh Warik (Computer Centre &amp; ACTC)</h2><br>
            A baby, born premature and also without sight was put on the ventilator 
            just like any other. She was made to breathe on her own. Understanding 
            the difficulties that would occur in her life and the extra hard work 
            she would need to put in to prove herself, this special child's parents 
            named her Tapasya. Tapasya was brought up in a nuclear family along 
            with her elder sister, Siddhika. Her father has been working at a 
            private bank and her mother is a home maker. Belonging to an educated 
            family, her parents educated both Tapassya and her elder sister equally.<br>
            <br>
            Tapasya after graduation successfully completed her MS-CIT course 
            and the Advanced Computer Training Course conducted by MNB, in collaboration 
            with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). She later appeared for the IBPS

            was successful and secured high marks because of her hard work. She 
            was now faced with the challenge of clearing different bank interviews 
            in order to obtain the appointment letter. During the Dena Bank interview 
            she was asked by the panel about her contribution to the day-to-day 
            banking activities and Tapasya therefore gave them a demonstration 
            in Word and Excel with the help of JAWS. They were very impressed 
            with her performance and selected her for the Clerical post. Tapasya 
            is now working with a Dena Bank branch in Mumbai.<br>

            <h2>Namrata Sallian ( Computer Centre &amp; ACTC)</h2><br>
            Namrata Sallian a M.Com. post graduate with low vision was confused 
            with regards to a career choice as she found it difficult to operate 
            the computer due to her visual impairment. "However after joining 
            MNB Computer Centre, I experienced for the first time how computers 
            can be accessed with the help of a screen reader like JAWS by visually 
            impaired persons." She gained confidence with her knowledge from these 
            rich experiences. She also completed her ACTC (Advanced Computer Training 
            Centre) course conducted by TCS at MNB. <br>
            <br>
            Namrata today acknowledges the vital role of MNB in her career. "I 
            soon found myself at Net System Informatics Pvt. Ltd. (Barrier Break 
            Technologies) as an accessibility tester in 2011. I will always be 
            grateful to MNB for their effective training and for bringing about 
            a fulfilling change in my life."<br>

            Pinkesh Tailor has a Master's in Marketing Management from Mumbai 
            University. He worked as a sales executive for the 14 years. After 
            a while he found it challenging to continue field work. Due to constant 
            exposure and pollution there was always the fear of his partial sight 
            being lost. Worried that he may not be able to see at all, he decided 
            to quit his job and join the Advance Computer Training for the visually 
            impaired being conducted by MNB.<br>
            <br>
            "This course not only gave me advanced knowledge about computers but 
            also gave me confidence to aim higher in life. Armed with the necessary 
            skills and more positive spirit I have managed to secure a job in 
            TCS and life couldn't be better."<br>

 <h2>Kalimutu (Self-Employment Scheme)</h2><br>
            Struggle and hard work lead to success.<br>
            <br>
            Parents and siblings love, teachers guidance and friends support are 
            the essence of any person's success. However, there are some people 
            who, despite not having any of this, are able to achieve great heights 
            because of hard work and struggle. Mr. Kalimutu is one such example 
            who was born as an orphan. However, his perseverance brought him into 
            the mainstream.<br>
            <br>
            Mr. Kalimutu a resident of Chennai enrolled for the 4-year training 
            at M N B Home for the Blind. During the 4-year training he learned 
            caning, weaving and light engineering and this motivated him about 
            his career.<br>
            <br>
            After completion of training he took up a job in a factory for sometime 
            and subsequently switched to hawking business.<br>
            <br>
            However since the hawking business failed to provide sufficient returns 
            to him, he switched over to selling rat poison door-to-door. However, 
            this too didn't satisfy him and he was therefore in the search of 
            an alternative business.<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly he could see light at the end of the tunnel when he heard 
            about the Self Employment Scheme launched by MNB for its ex-trainees. 
            After a consultation with the Project Coordinator, Mr. Kalimutu concluded 
            that the envelope-making business would be the most suitable option 
            for him because these envelopes would also come handy for packaging 
            the rat poison and in May 2009 MNB Home launched this business for 
            him. This was the turning point in his life and his life-style also 
            gradually improved. He started taking orders for big companies as 
            well and MNB also buys these envelopes. These envelopes are also used 
            to package the rat poison. His wife and 2 sons are also involved in 
            the business and this boosted his confidence to such a great extent 
            that he has now started thinking like a true entrepreneur who is always 
            greedy for more success.<br>
            <br>
            This burning desire to achieve more and more drove Mr. Kalimutu to 
            to expand his business. He now makes envelopes of different sizes 
            weight and also prints the name and address of the concerned party. 
            If required, he also makes DTPs along with his sons. Thus, Mr. Kalimutu 
            is a manifestation of those who strive of becoming entrepreneurs, 
            but give up at the first stage itself because of some hurdles.<br>

            <h2>Vijay Kamble (Current Trainee)</h2><br>
            Glaucoma creates barriers but determination breaks them.<br>
            <br>
            I, Vijay Kamble, was born sighted and completed SSC in 2001. After 
            this, I came to Mumbai to make a living for my family and me. Days 
            passed by and soon I was even able to get my younger sister married. 
            However suddenly my whole world came crashing down as I was diagnosed 
            with Glaucoma that led to a total loss of sight. I start believing 
            that this was the end of my life. But I soon got to hear about the 
            vocational training at MNB Home and enrolled for the same. This training 
            gave me a dream of reliving my life to the fullest. Though I was not 
            interested in continuing my education after SSC, MNB enabled me do 
            so and I am now pursuing my HSC at a night college. After completing 
            my HSC, my ambition is to become a physiotherapist and serve society 
            because I feel that it is my responsibility to return what I've got 
            so far.<br>

            The loss of sight cannot stop an educational mind.<br>
            <br>
            I Ramrao Wadave thankful to MNB Home for enabling me stand on my feet 
            by providing me a wonderful vocational training. The homely atmosphere 
            here and its caring and affectionate staff made me feel at home. I 
            was born blind and was faced with many difficulties during my childhood, 
            including being abandoned by my father. There was a break in my education 
            after class 2 because of a lack of awareness of writers. I was now 
            just whiling away my time and one day a friend of mine, an ex-trainee 
            of MNB Home, suggested that I too enrol for the vocational training 
            at MNB. Becoming a trainee of MNB Home, I learned various trades that 
            boosted my confidence of being able to do something. Suddenly, there 
            was a light at the end of my dark tunnel and I was able to continue 
            my education. I cleared the entrance exam of class 7 and enrolled 
            for class 8 in Maratha Vidya Mandir Night School. It was the happiest 
            moment of my life when I passed my SSC with a 1st class. My family 
            also felt a great sense of pride. This achievement increased my hunger 
            to further educate myself and because of MNB's undying support, I 
            took admission in a night college. It is my dream to one of the best 
            masseur and be an inspiration to my other fellow visually challenged. 
            Not only do I want to be educated, but also civilized and contribute 
            in the process of nation building.<p></p>
